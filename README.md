# Arduino-TicTacToe-Game

Created a touchscreen Arduino TicTacToe game that has two types of modes: Versus CPU and Versus Player. The CPU capable of winning against the player, be beaten by the player, or end in a draw with the player. If there is another human opponent that wishes to face against the player in tictactoe then that is also possible as well. 

The following components needed for this setup are the following:
1x Arduino Uno
1x 2.8" TouchScreen for Arduino

The video below demonstrates the Arduino TicTacToe game in the two modes.
